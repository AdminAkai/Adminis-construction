          I made Adminis to demonstrate where innovation and passion meet
          technology. I&apos;m Josh Trinidad, the driving force behind this
          one-man-army company. My journey in the world of programming started
          in highschool, and I&apos;ve been doing it professionally for a little
          over 8 years now. Over time, I&apos;ve honed my skills, staying
          forefront of industry trends and best practices. I love to learn, and
          programming never stops teaching.

          Reach out and contact me, either as Adminis or Josh, and let&apos;s
          work together. Whether it&apos;s the next big thing you want to build
          from the ground up, or just a job position that needs filling,
          I&apos;m available for all. Click on any of the panels to get to know
          more about me and to get started.

        <AboutSummaryText>
          I am currently rebuilding Adminis to use ThreeJS for WebGL and 3D
          rendering while not sacrificing any of its current accessibility, as
          well as working on a ton of personal projects. I&apos;ll set them so
          you can view them here, but they&apos;ll also be available on my
          Github (the source code for this site is also there). Stay tuned!
